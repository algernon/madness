Another week almost gone, and there are a lot of progress to report on the
ErgoDox front. I tweaked my layout further, but there are less changes this
time, and most of them under the hood: not how the keys are laid out, but how
they behave. Mind you, there were still some minor changes here and there.

Lets look at the current base layout!

There are four major changes on the layout, some visible, some not:

* The bottom row was rearranged, to have cursor movements split between the two
  halves, and to have `:` and `-` in an easier to access position. Still not
  perfect, but I think this is a step in the right direction.
* The top row gained function keys, which trigger when the keys are pressed for
  a longer period of time. The motivation behind this change is that I got rid
  of the symbol layer, which was home to the function keys. I wanted access to
  the function keys, for some OS shurtcuts, mostly. Since I use these rarely, a
  long press is fine.
* The modifiers are now non-sticky, but rather act as one-shot modifiers. That
  is, the next key tapped within 3 seconds after releasing the modifier, will
  have the modifier applied. Holding the key sends the modifier. Most of the
  time, I found that I only type a single shifted key. Nevertheless, I still
  don't want to hold modifiers, so one-shot behaviour is perfect. Doubly so,
  because double-tapping toggles them into a sticky state! This way, I can type
  many shifted keys, if I need to, or combine it with other modifiers, without
  having to hold any of them. The only downside of the built-in functionality,
  is that I can't cancel a one-shot modifier if I change my mind, or if I
  accidentally pressed it. So I turned `ESC` into a cancel button: if a one-shot
  modifier is active, it clears all of them, otherwise acts as a normal `ESC`
  key.
* The **SYMBOL** layer is gone, the **NAV** and **EDIT** layers have been merged
  into an **EMACS** layer, and a new one-handed layer was introduced.
  
Thanks to the practice, and the tweaks above, I am now reaching 50+ WPM, with
97% or better accuracy. I even crossed the 55 WPM mark, and am only about 4 WPM
below my all-time Dvorak record, and am over half the speed of my old QWERTY
speed!

I also continued recording some of my typing sessions, but this time, with a
better setup: both halves of the keyboard recorded, along with my screen. See
below for a short typing video, and I'll continue with some observation about
the keyboard after the video.

Over the course of the past four weeks, I learned to love the keyboard, despite
all its flaws (of which, there aren't many). As many people before me noticed,
the thumb cluster is far from perfect. There's basically two keys I can reach
comfortably during a typing session, the other four are still useful, but only
for things one does not do often. This makes them perfect candidates for
one-shot modifiers.

I also dislike the bottom row. Apart from the innermost key on it, it isn't easy
to reach, and more often than not, I rather avoid the row alltogether.

The key sizes on the sides of the main cluster are also something I'd change: on
the inner sides, have the 1u key on the bottom, and the 1.5 ones on top of it;
on the outside, tall keys, rather than wide, would feel better.

The [keyboardio Model 01][km01] appears to fix all these issues, and I'm looking
forward to being able to play with it. Regardless, the ErgoDox EZ is still a
solid keyboard, one I plan to use for a looong time to come.

To 60WPM and beyond!
