title: "Recruitment mistakes: part 3"

It has been a while that I have been contacted by a recruiter, and the last few
ones were fairly decent conversations, where they made an effort to research me
first, and even if they did not get everything right, they still listened, and
we had a productive talk. But four days ago, I had another recruiter reach out
to me, from a company I know oh so well: one I
[ranted about before](/blog/2011/12/13/google-fail/): Google. Apparently, their
recruiters still do carpet-bombing style outreach. My first thought was "*what
took them so long?*" - it has been five years since my last contact with a
Google recruiter. I almost started missing them. Almost. To think that Google is
now powerful enough to read my mind, is scary. Yet, I believe, this is not the
case; rather, it's just another embarrassing mistake.

To make my case, let me quote the full e-mail I was sent, with the name of the
sender redacted, and my comments - which I'm also sending to the recruiter:

> Hi Gergely, 

Hi!

> How are you? Hope you're well.

Thank you, I'm fine, just back from vacation, and I was thrilled to read your
e-mail. Although, I did find it surprising too, and considering
[past events][0], I thought it to be spam first.

I'm happy that you found me through GitHub, but I'm curious why you mailed me at
my debian.org address then? That address is not on my GitHub profile, and even
though I have some code signed with that address, that's not what I use
normally. My [GitHub profile][1] also links to a page I created especially
[for recruiters][2], which I don't think you have read - but more on that below.

> ...and your experience with software development combined with your open source

Which part of my recent contributions are relevant to Google? For the past few
months, the vast majority (over 90%) of my open source work has been on
[keyboard firmware][3]. If Google is developing a keyboard, then this may be
relevant, otherwise, I find it doubtful.

Some of my past OSS contributions may be more relevant, but that's in the past,
and it would take some digging to see those from GitHub. And if you did that
kind of digging, you would have found the page on my site [for recruiters][2],
and would not have e-mailed me at my Debian address, either.

To make things short, my stance is the same as it was five years ago, [when I
wrote][0] - and I quote - "*So, here's a public request: do not email me ever
again about job opportunities within Google. I do not wish to work for Google.
Not now, not tomorrow, not ever.*"

This still stands. Please do not ever e-mail me about job opportunities within
Google. I do not wish to work for Google, not now, not tomorrow, not five years
from now, not ever. This will not change. Many things may change, this however,
will not.

But even if I ignore this, let me ask you mix of skills are you exactly
interested in? Keyboard firmware hacking, mixed with Emacs Lisp, some Clojure,
and hacking on Hy (which, if you have explored my GitHub profile, will surely
know) from time to time? Or is it my Debian Developer hat that got your
interest? If so, why didn't you say so? Not that it would change anything, but
I'm curious.

Is it my participation in 24pullrequests? Or my participation in GSoC in years past?

Nevertheless, my list of conditions I [mentioned above][2], apply. Is Google
able to fulfill **all** my requirements, and the preferences too? Last time I
heard, working for Google required one to relocate, which I clearly said on that
page, I'm not willing to do.

And how would these be interesting to me, considering my recent OSS work? (Hint:
none of them interest me, not a bit. Ok perhaps MapReduce, a little.)

My career is already developing fine, thank you, I do not need Google to do
that. I am already working on things I consider important and interesting, if I
wanted to change, I would. But I certainly would not consider a company which I
had asked numerous times NOT to contact me about opportunities. If you can't
respect this wish, and forget about this in mere five years, why would I trust
you to keep any other promises you make now?

> Thank you so much for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.

I wish you had spent as much time researching me - or even half that - as I have
spent replying to you. I suppose this is not the reply you were expecting, or
looking for, but this is the only one I'll ever give to anyone from Google.

And here, at the end, if you read this far, I'm asking you, and everyone at
Google to **never** contact me about job opportunities. I will not work for
Google. Not now, not tomorrow, not five years from now, not ever. Please do not
e-mail me again, and do not reply to this e-mail either. I'm not interested in
neither apologies, nor promises that you won't contact me - just simply don't do
it.

Thank you.
