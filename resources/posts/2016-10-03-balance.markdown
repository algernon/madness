Just like last time, the focus of this post is [keyboard.io][kbdio] and ADORE.
There are plenty of news to report on both sides! A lot of progress has been
made on the arduino front, to make it possible to have the behaviour I desire on
the Model 01 - only the Leader key is missing, and I have a good idea about its
implementation, too. On the other front, ADORE has seen a huge update again,
aimed at reducing pinky use, and balancing the hands out. We'll see after this
post how that worked in practice.

## keyboard.io

Lets start with the easier topic: my [multi-key library][gh:atd]. Last time it
only had a tap-dance implementation, now it also has one-shot keys (and
modifiers).

What's the difference between the two? Easy: when interrupted, one-shot keys
deactivate after the interrupting key, while tap-dance deactivates after. They
ended up being two separate implementations due to this difference in behaviour.

An implementation of a Leader key is also in the works, along with much more
documentation.

## ADORE

There are much bigger changes on ADORE: analysing the heatmap from last time
(see below), it turned out that hand balance was far off, pinky use was too
high, and the other fingers weren't all that good, either. I also found a bug in
the heatmap generator, so my former stats weren't entirely correct.

Nevertheless, a long night spent on testing various changes, I think I have
something that may stick:

Typing is strange, as this is yet another big rearrangement, and some keys feel
off, like `y`, `~`, and `f`. But strangely, `m` feels fine. I suppose more
testing is needed, but this is about as much as I wanted to write for now.
Perhaps I will do some typing tests...

# Parting thoughts

This concludes the update, and like last time, we finish with a heatmap of the
layout, collected while writing this post:

I ran my text-to-keylog tool on this post, and if I entered it as-is, without
corrections or editor assistance, the heatmap would have looked like this:
