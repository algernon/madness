So I have been playing with the ErgoDox some more, and things are getting
better! I have put together a [visual aid][layout] now, which is a great help.
Touch typing is still slow, because I never properly learnt it before. Modifiers
are also awkward to use, I may have to relocate them closer to the thumbs - or
at least, move SHIFT closer, as that is what I use most often.

There are a number of things I've been fighting with, such as trying to get the
middle mouse button to register. No luck so far.
