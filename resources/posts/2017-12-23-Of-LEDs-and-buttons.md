I've been thinking about LEDs. I definitely do not want a LED under the ball, but perhaps they could be useful under the buttons? And while there, what about underglow? Between the two, I think underglow would make the more sense, and it would be the least disturbing too.

On another note, I'm more and more convinced that I'll have to experiment with a thumb-controlled trackball.

While pondering about LEDs, and explaining my reasoning to my wife, we drifted off to ball mounts, and concluded that the deeper-sunk ones are not going to work, for two reasons: first, the thumb must be sufficiently far from the buttons, and the mount for these things is way too big; second, having conducted a small trial, I don't think they'd be comfortable enough.

With this concluded, we went on to discuss buttons. Two buttons are given, one for the index, another for the middle finger. I can't use these to toggle between movement and scrolling, because there are situations where I want to scroll and click, and setting this up with reusable buttons would not be easy. So I need a third button. But where do I put it?

I first thought about a palm key, but with a thumb-operated ball, that would be awkward. I could put a bar under the base of my hand, which should be easier to press, but I need to experiment to see if I can avoid accidentally pressing it. I could place a button on the side, thumb-accessible: perhaps not the most comfortable, and not suitable for holding, but I only want to toggle scrolling with it anyway. This does not feel entirely right, though.

Putting a key on ring-finger or pinky is not acceptable. I *might* put a second one on the index or middle finger, though... one I can push by straightening out my finger. I thought of this before, so perhaps it isn't a terrible idea.

Wife also asked me if I want to buy a thumb-operated trackball to see if I like it in the first place. For now, I don't feel the need to. I'll first build something out of cardbox and play-doh, and borrow a ball from my existing trackball (it doesn't have to move, I just want to check how it feels to operate it). Cardboard and play-doh is cheaper, easier to re-use, and way more fun. I can also ask around at work to see if anyone has a Logitech M570 or similar that I could try...
