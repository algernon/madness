Just saw a [video of a giant trackball](https://vimeo.com/68424161), and I started to wonder if it would make sense for me to build one. Clicking would be a problem, but 99% of the time when I'm trackballing around, I have my other hand on the keyboard, and could click there. Most things handle two mice doing coordinated gymnastics...

This would solve all kinds of issues I had while designing Ommatidia. I don't need to care about tenting, because it's a ball, I can place my hand on the surface pretty much anywhere. No need to figure out button positions either, because there are none. No need to decide between thumb and finger trackball: it would be a hand-ball instead.

I'm tempted to build one, just to try things out. It shouldn't be cost-prohibitive, and I might be able to reuse some of the components if I decide to tear it down.

The temptation to touch hardware just increased considerably,  and I even have a soldering kit now...
