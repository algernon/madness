Been using the ErgoDox for almost a week now, and it is starting to get better!
I rarely have to consult the printed layout anymore, but I make plenty of errors
still, mostly because I am trying to pay attention to type with all ten fingers.
The layout itself (pictured below) feels close to final, although only the base
and the Hungarian layers are tested well - the rest, I have not used all that
much yet.

The firmware is at the
[usual](https://github.com/algernon/qmk_firmware/blob/ergodox-ez/algernon/keyboard/ergodox_ez/keymaps/algernon/keymap.c)
place.

There are a number of things about this layout that are common on other ErgoDox
layouts, such as the layer switchers on the side: when tapped, they send the
key, but when held, they temporarily switch to another layer. I did add a few
twists though! For example, the keen reader can see that I do not appear to have
a `SHIFT` key, just something below `HOME` that looks like a `CAPS LOCK`.
Indeed, I do not have a traditional `SHIFT`: mine is sticky, like the `CAPS
LOCK`, but it also affects the number row and symbols too. This is achieved by
programming the keyboard so that the key is toggle-able. Surprisingly, it was
very easy to get used to it, and it made my pinky much happier too, as it
doesn't have to stretch out and reach it anymore.

Additionally, I also have the brackets - and square brackets - easily accessible
by either a thumb or an index finger. I use these often when coding, so I
figured, why not put them there?

My typing speed is still awful, but improving, I can do 20 WPM consistently now,
with over 95% accuracy. If I pay less attention to proper typing, or accuracy,
then I can reach 40 WPM too. But accuracy is important, so plenty of training is
still ahead of me, until I can switch to this keyboard at work.
