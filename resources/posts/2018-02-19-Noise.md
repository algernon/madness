All my keyboards at home have silent, non-clicky switches, except one prototype which has Kailh Greens. This is good, because I do not like noisy keyboards, and have no use for the click (I'm listening to music anyway). Yet, our twins love the sound of the switches. However, I need to return the prototype, and will not have any clicky boards at home then. This led me down a thought process that started with building a clicky keyboard, and ended up with asking myself this: what if I made the trackball buttons clicky? Not as many keys as on a keyboard, so I can't roll my fingers over it, but still enough buttons to keep two little kids occupied for a good few minutes with all the clicking while I game.

So I have another part of the build figured out: noisy switches for the buttons, no matter how the buttons end up. If I can't find a mechanical clicky switch that would be comfortable (because arcade buttons are back on the table with a thumb-operated trackball), then I'll consider adding a speaker, and play clicky noises from firmware. That has the advantage of being easy to turn off when I want the device to be quiet... Perhaps I should go that way from the start?
