This is not how it all started. It all started with a [picture][imgur:ltrac-wood], and then some [brain dumping][m:ommatidia-beginning]. I put the idea aside after [writing a blog post][a:trackball-quest] about it. But last night, when I was casually browsing around, half asleep, I failed a saving throw as we say it. Having failed it, I had no other choice, but to pursue the idea further, and that's how the first sketch was born:

Pretty simple, though obviously needs a lot of work. This is just something I've done in Inkscape in like five minutes.

But it got me thinking about the properties of the trackball. I started imagining how I'd use it, whether the arcade thumb buttons and palm key would be useful, or too much. Started wondering how much it would cost me to build it, and if I can even find all the components I need.

So I went to [Adafruit][adafruit], to see if I can find anything. I should not have. So many weird and dangerous ideas!

What if I used small [thumb joysticks](https://www.adafruit.com/product/512) instead of the arcade buttons? They could double as scroll wheels, too. This sounded neat first, but what if I want to scroll *and* click? Sure, I could make the other stick into the opposite button, but operating two things with the same thumb is not going to work well. It was a useful thought experiment, nevertheless.

Then, I found a [scrubber knob](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2055), which is much closer to an arcade button, can work as a button too, but I can also use it as a scroll wheel, in addition to using the ball. So if I want to scroll + click, I scroll with the ball, click with these. If I just want to scroll, I just turn the knob with my thumb. This is an idea I haven't given up on yet.

But... here's the thing: [arcade buttons](https://www.adafruit.com/product/471) look great. They just go incredibly well with what I had in mind.

I tried to search for a suitable optical sensor on Adafruit, but found none. Thankfully, there is a [promising one][adns-9800] available elsewhere, with sweet properties, perfect for a trackball.

This is as far as I got - along with choosing a name, [thanks James][m:ommatidia] for the suggestion!

Oh, I also ran into a [foot switch](https://www.dafruit.com/product/423). Not sure how that'd go with a trackball, but it is something I want to eventually play with, too.
