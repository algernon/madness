In the past, I usually updated every week, but this last one took longer, almost
two weeks. Not because things finally settled down, no.
[It's never over][blog:ed:54]. Lots of things are happening on the keyboard
front, a good amount of experimenting was and is being made. The changes this
time are less radical, perhaps, at least as far as the base layer is concerned.
Other layers... well, they did see some bigger updates.

The changes are mostly fueled by my need for comfort, and were usually committed
after a reasonable time of being used. The other source for continued tweaking
is simplification. There is a behaviour that I really, really wanted to do, but
the QMK firmware did not provide the necessary functionality out of the box, so
a big chunk of this post will be about this feature: a way to allow keys to
perform different functions based on the number of taps they receive, keeping
the order of keypresses.

I will also briefly update on my experiment with a standing table.

## Keyboard layout changes

Lets recall how the layout looked on day 54:

![Base layer, day 54](/assets/asylum/images/posts/ergodox-day-54/base-layer.png)

I didn't like how the cursor movement and navigation keys were laid out, so that
part was completely reimagined. I now have four buttons total for them, and a
fifth key to toggle between cursor movement and navigation keys.

Furthermore, I moved the `=+` symbols onto the home row, because they see
considerably more use than any of `\|`, thus, they had to be swapped. I'm slowly
getting used to this.

With these, the new layout looks as follows:

![Base layer](/assets/asylum/images/posts/ergodox-day-66/base-layer.png)

The most interesting change, however, happened under the hood, and is
[slowly making its way towards QMK][qmk:pr:449]. It all started with the `;`
symbol, which used to live under `A`, but was moved to the same key as `:`, so
when shifted, that key would input a `;` instead of a `:`. But the problem was,
that the key is either tapped by the thumb, which also taps the `Shift` key, or
my fingers have to do an uncomfortable dance, and I don't like those. So I
revisited an old idea, one I've been intrigued about for a while, but also one
where my experiments did not succeed: having the key input `:` on single tap,
but `;` on double, preserving the order of keys pressed if the tap sequence is
ignored.

 [qmk:pr:449]: https://github.com/jackhumbert/qmk_firmware/pull/449
 
There is a similar implementation in QMK already, but that suffers from a number
of issues:

* It does not preserve keypress order when a tap sequence is interrupted. So if
  I tap `;a` quickly, I may end up with `a;`, and that is not something I want.
* It requires a lot of code to implement even a single key with this behaviour.

My solution addresses both issues, and makes it trivial to have different
actions for the different number of key presses. If you want to be able to tap a
key a hundred times, and then do some funny action, you can do that, easily.

I will not go into the details of how this works exactly, the
[pull request][qmk:pr:449] above goes into sufficient detail.

### Next steps

Once the pull request is accepted, I will migrate my layout to use the feature
(right now, only an experimental branc of mine does this). And then, I will
probably start playing with my experimental layout more seriously. I have
collected a lot of data about my typing habits: which keys I press, how often,
and in what combinations?

Armed with this knowledge, I will try to evaluate the layout I came up with.

As for the next update... that will be a while, because I will not be able to
play with a keyboard in early july, and I am unsure whether there will be
interesting news to share.

## Standing desk experience

At work, I am still sitting, but not for long. The plan is to transition to a
standing desk this week. At home, I stand, or rather, walk. I found that
standing still is both boring, and not good for my feet. So I walk around when
I'm thinking, or do squats, or something. I also sit down from time to time: to
eat, to relax and immerse into music for a few minutes. And no, there is still
no picture of the setup. I'd have to clean my desk and the surrounding area
first, to make it presentable... nah. I'll snap a picture of the setup at work,
once ready instead. A much better environment for photo purposes.

My productivity is through the roof. I feel energised, passionate. I also lost
almost five kilogramms in the past three weeks (partly because we've been
exercising with my wife, changed my diet, and I'm sure standing also
contributes).

My mother, who has been working in a pharmacy for decades, on her feet eight
hours and more a day, has some reservations about this standing desk idea. It
will be interesting to compare our experiences, and figure out how to combat the
issues she has been experiencing. My stance is that the two are not really
comparable, the load on one's feet is much different when one works at a
standing desk voluntarily, with the option to walk when he sees fit, sit down
when he wants; and between someone who has no choice, and far less options to
ease the burden placed on her feet.
