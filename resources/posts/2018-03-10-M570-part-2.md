The M570 arrived yesterday, and I was able to spend a few hours casually testing it, trying to get used to the thumb-operated ball. It's not going too well. While I like the form, and the feel of controlling the ball with my thumb, my precision plummeted, and I keep wanting to click with my thumb. Both on my Orbit, and on my keyboards, I "click" with my thumb a lot. Not being able to do that on the M570 feels awkward.

Regarding precision, I found that I can position the cursor in a general idea, roughly, pretty well. It's the fine motions that cause trouble. Configuring, tweaking some settings may be a remedy for that, but I haven't tried yet.

Meanwhile, it still looks like that I'll prefer a finger-ball instead of a thumb-ball in the long run. But just last night, thinking about tilting, it occurred to me that tilting the trackball might not be the best idea, because that might make it harder to roll the ball against the tilt direction. This is something to consider and experiment with, too.
