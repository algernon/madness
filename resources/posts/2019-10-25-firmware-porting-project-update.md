A while ago I put up a [project page](/projects/keyboard-firmware/), where I
offered a few deals: send me a keyboard to port [Kaleidoscope][kaleidoscope] to,
or donate to my [Liberapay][liberapay] fund, and once there's enough funds
there, I'll get a board from the wishlist, and do the porting work. There are
some news to share about the project!

A few people contacted me about boards, but nothing came out of that yet. Others
generously donated to the Liberapay fund, enough to allow me to order an
[Azeron][azeron] keypad! I paid the VAT & shipping cost, but the rest has been
covered from donations. Thank you, all of you!

Now to wait 'till the board gets here, and then I can figure out all the nuances
of porting Kaleidoscope to something wild.
