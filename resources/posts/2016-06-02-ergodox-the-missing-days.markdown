Since I had my [ErgoDox EZ][ed:ez], I have worked not only on
[my own layout][gh:ergodox-layout],
[documenting the larger steps][blog:ergodox], but I have also created other
layouts, for the amusement of myself or others.

 [gh:ergodox-layout]: https://github.com/algernon/ergodox-layout

[These layouts][gh:crazies] are all a little bit crazy, one way or the other...
