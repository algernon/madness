For the past couple of days, I've been pondering about how I would mount the ball, and this may very well end up being the hardest part. I do not have a 3D printer, nor do I have easy access to one, so prototyping will be a bit hard.

I did find a [blog post][blog:madox:trackball] about someone else on a similar journey, which appears to be a decent resource. Having tried to search for DIY trackballs, most solutions were either reusing existing components, or looked like a brick, or both.

Having searched further, I found a [reddit thread][reddit:trackball:diy-components], which led me to a [listing of ball bearings][ebay:ball-bearings], a [deskthority thread][deskthority:frictionless-trackball], lots of ideas to digest from there.

While browsing Deskthority, I came across [another thread][deskthority:custom-trackball], with a different solution for the mounting problem. [GeekHack][geekhack:custom-ergo-trackball] also has an interesting thread about the subject.

Also ran across a lot of half-ready, off-the-shelf "DIY Arcade Trackball" things, but those were all very far from what I want. I don't think I could salvage them for some components, either. For reference, here's [one shop][suzohapp] that sells such components. Perhaps worth considering one, after all...

There's also [this funny video](https://vimeo.com/69113731) of a giant trackball. Not really useful, but hey. This is a journal, not a schematic.
