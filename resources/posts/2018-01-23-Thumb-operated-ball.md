So back in December, I was conducting a thought-experiment of building a trackball that is not finger-operated like my Orbit, but thumb-operated. I wasn't originally a big fan of thumb-balls, back when I was evaluating trackballs. But then, I used to hate trackballs too, and now I can't imagine using anything else as a pointing device. So, thumb-operated ones deserve a second chance, and a more thorough evaluation.

Which led me to try operating my Orbit with my thumb. It was a huge disappointment. Movement speed was abysmal. You see, when using fingers, I usually use three: index, middle, and ring. If I want to move the cursor far away, I'll just roll all three over the ball. Nice and easy. But with a thumb-operated ball, I can't do that, I only have one thumb per hand (and frankly, I don't mind that). So if I go down this route, I will need to build it so that it can spin more freely, to allow me to cross larger distances with reasonable speed, without having to reposition my thumb on the ball. I'll just spin it, lift my thumb, let it roll, and stop it when reaching the desired area, and position more accurately from there.

At least, that's the plan. I may need to try a trackball with a free-er ball, to see how that works in practice. Or a real thumb-operated one, not just one in my head, or a slightly tilted finger-trackball.
