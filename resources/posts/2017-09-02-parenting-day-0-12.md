On the 20th of August, shortly after posting the previous post on this blog, we
went to the hospital for a routine check up. As we were expecting any day now,
we went with everything packed, and how good we did so! As usual, I was waiting
outside while my wife went in, but five minutes later, she walks out, and says
the most beautiful words I ever heard until that day: "*We are staying*". The
next half an hour was spent notifying family, and a few hours later - shortly
after half past eleven - Zsombor & Lilla let the world know that they arrived,
from the top of their lungs.

## Day 0

August 20th was short, but I got to hold our babies for a bit over half an hour.
There were tears of joy.

## Day 1-3

Mother & twins stayed in the hospital, I visited every day, stayed as long as I
could. Then went home to prepare the house for their arrival (cleaning, putting
things away, you name it).

## Day 4

Oh boy. We thought we were prepared, both mentally and physically. We have never
been so wrong in our life before. The journey home was surprisingly calm, not a
cry, not a whim was heard. That should have been a clue, because come the night,
the twins, who were so silent, so well behaved, turned into attention-demanding
little noise boxes. Adorable, lovable, perfect little noise boxes, but oh boy.
When you have absolutely no idea what's wrong, no clue why they are crying, why
they appear to be in the most possible pain a person can be in, when you feel
helpless, confused, and overwhelmed - there's no preparation for that.

Our first night home was a complete disaster, and had everyone in tears at one
point. But we survived, against all odds.

## Day 5-12

Not going into much detail, but things started to get better after the first
night. We are getting used to each other, and the twins to the world. We can
reasonably guess now what the little king & queen want: food, diaper change,
attention, something to ease their tummies. We are starting to develop a rhythm,
where we have time not only to care about the kids, but to care about ourselves
too.

It's an incredible feeling to be a dad of two such amazing creatures. What is
even funnier, that even at such an early stage, we are starting to see patterns.
Patterns about their behaviour that remind us of someone. For example, Zsombor
sleeps exactly the way I do, while Lilla's facial expressions are like her
mother's. And both of them are night owls, like their dad. Whops. Sorry about
that, Csilla!

We are taking a lot of pictures, notes, and I'm keeping a diary of our daily
lives. Hope this will be something we can look back at fondly. Something to help
us when the next "batch" arrives (aiming at 15th March, 2019, for a variety of
crazy reasons, chief among them is that both wife & myself were born on the 1st
of May, a holiday; twins on the 20th, another holiday; and 15th March would be a
holiday too). But alas, that is so far down the road that it is not worth
concentrating on.

For now, we are enjoying every moment of time together. Even if it is tiring (it
is *incredibly* tiring), even if it is hard (it is so much harder than we
anticipated), even if it is disgusting (so much poop!), even if it is crazy (why
are they crying *now*??), being their parent is still something I wouldn't want
to trade for anything.

# Thanks

Now, if you read this far, I'll share with you a little tradition my father
introduced in our family: on select occasions, when we had guests, we gave them
presents. Becoming a dad of two beautiful children, this is as special an
occasion as it can get. My present to you - with a little help from Jesse
of [Keyboardio][keyboardio] - is a discount code: when pre-ordering a
new [Model 01][keyboardio], use the discount code `ALGERNON` for a small
discount, and have a drink on my behalf!
