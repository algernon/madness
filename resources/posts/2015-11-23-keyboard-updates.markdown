Last Friday, I [compiled a list of keyboards][blog:looking-for-keyboard] I'm
interested in, and received a lot of incredible feedback, thank you all! This
allowed me to shorten the list considerably, two basically two pieces. I'm
reasonably sure by now which one I want to buy (both), but will spend this week
calming down to avoid impulse-buying. My attention was also brought to a few
keyboards originally not on my list, and I'll take this opportunity to present
my thoughts on those too.

# The Finalists

[img:ergodox]: /assets/asylum/images/posts/looking-for-a-keyboard/ergodox.jpg "ErgoDox"

### Pros

* Great design, by the looks of it.
* Mechanical keys.
* Open source hardware and firmware, thus programmable.
* Thumb keys.
* Available as an assembled product, from multiple sources.

### Cons

* Primarily a kit, but assembled available.
* Assembled versions aren't as nice as home-made variants.

### Summary

The keyboard looks interesting, primarily due to the thumb keys. From the
ErgoDox EZ campaign, I'm looking at **$270**. That's friendly, and makes ErgoDox
a viable option! (Thanks [@miffe](https://twitter.com/miffe)!)

There's also another option, [FalbaTech][falbatech], which ships sooner, I can
customize the keyboard to some extent, and Poland is much closer to Hungary than
the US. With this option, I'm looking at **$205** + shipping, a very low price
for what the keyboard has to offer. (Thanks
[@pkkolos](https://twitter.com/pkkolos) for the suggestion!)

![Keyboardio Model 01][img:m01]

[img:m01]: /assets/asylum/images/posts/looking-for-a-keyboard/m01.jpg "Keyboardio Model 01"

### Pros

* Mechanical keyboard.
* Hardwood body.
* Blank and dot-only keycaps option.
* Open source: firmware, hardware, and so on. Comes with a screwdriver.
* The physical key layout has much in common with my TypeMatrix.
* Numerous thumb-accessible keys.
* A palm key, that allows me to use the keyboard as a mouse.
* Fully programmable LEDs.
* Custom macros, per-application even.

### Cons

* Fairly expensive.
* Custom keycap design, thus rearranging them physically is not an option, which
  leaves me with the blank or dot-only keycap options only.
* Available late summer, 2016.

### Summary

With shipping cost and whatnot, I'm looking at something in the **$370**
ballpark, which is on the more expensive side. On the other hand, I get a whole
lot of bang for my buck: LEDs, two center bars (tripod mounting sounds really
awesome!), hardwood body, and a key layout that is very similar to what I came
to love on the TypeMatrix.

I also have a thing for wooden stuff. I like the look of it, the feel of it.

# The Verdict

Right now, I'm seriously considering the [Model 01](#m01), because even if it is
about twice the price of the [ErgoDox](#ergodox), it also offers a lot more:
hardwood body (I love wood), LEDs, palm key. I also prefer the layout of the
thumb keys on the Model 01.

The Model 01 also comes pre-assembled, looks stunning, while the ErgoDox pales a
little in comparsion. I know I could make it look stunning too, but I do not
want to build things. I'm not good at it, I don't want to be good at it, I don't
want to learn it. I hate putting things together. I'm the kind of guy who needs
three tries to put together a set of IKEA shelves, and I'm not exaggerating. I
also like the shape of the keys better on the Model 01.

Nevertheless, the ErgoDox is still an option, due to the price. I'd love to buy
both, if I could. Which means that once I'm ready to replace my keyboard at
work, I will likely buy an ErgoDox. But for home, Model 01 it is, unless
something even better comes along before my next pay.

The
[Kinesis Advantage](/blog/2015/11/20/looking-for-a-keyboard/#kinesis-advantage)
was also a strong contender, but I ended up removing it from my preferred
options, because it doesn't come with blank keys, and is not a split keyboard.
And similar to the ErgoDox, I prefer the Model 01's thumb-key layout. Despite
all this, I'm very curious about the key wells, and want to try it someday.

# Suggested options

Suggested by
[Andred Carter](https://plus.google.com/+GergelyNagy-MHP/posts/SxaMLRAJ3DV), a
very interesting keyboard with a unique design.

### Pros

* Portable, foldable.
* Active support for forearm and hand.
* Hands never obstruct the view.

### Cons

* Not mechanical.
* Needs a special inlay.
* Best used for word processing, programmers may run into limitations.

### Summary

I like the idea of the keyboard, and if it wouldn't need a special inlay, but
used a small screen or something to show the keys, I'd like it even more.
Nevertheless, I'm looking for a mechanical keyboard right now, which I can also
use for coding.

But I will definitely keep the Yogitype in mind for later!

[img:matias]: /assets/asylum/images/posts/keyboard-updates/matias.jpg "Matias Ergo Pro"

### Pros

* Mechanical keys.
* Simple design.
* Split keyboard.

### Cons

* Doesn't seem to come with a blank keys option, nor in Dvorak.
* No thumb key area.
* Neither open source, nor open hardware.
* I have no need for the dedicated undo, cut, paste keys.
* Does not appear to be programmable.

### Summary

This keyboard hardly meets any of my desired properties, and doesn't have
anything standing out in comparison with the others. I had a quick look at this
when compiling my original list, but was quickly discarded. Nevertheless, people
asked me why, so I'm including my reasoning here:

While it is a split keyboard, with a fairly simple design, it doesn't come in
the layout I'd prefer, nor with blank keys. It lacks the thumb key area that
[ErgoDox](#ergodox) and the [Model 01](#m01) have, and which I developed an
affection for.

[Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard](https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/keyboards/sculpt-ergonomic-desktop/l5v-00001)
------------------------------

![Microsoft Sculpt][img:sculpt]

[img:sculpt]: /assets/asylum/images/posts/keyboard-updates/sculpt.jpg "Microsoft Sculpt"

### Pros

* Numpad is a separate unit.
* Reverse tilt.
* Well positioned, big Alt keys.
* Cheap.

### Cons

* Not a split keyboard.
* Not mechanical.
* No blank or Dvorak option as far as I see.

### Summary

This keyboard does not buy me much over my current TypeMatrix 2030. If I'd be
looking for the cheapest possible among ergonomic keyboards, this would be my
choice. But only because of the price.

[Truly Ergonomic Keyboard](https://www.trulyergonomic.com/store/index.php)
---------------------

![Truly Ergonomic Keyboard][img:terg]

[img:terg]: /assets/asylum/images/posts/keyboard-updates/terg.jpg "Truly Ergonomic Keyboard"

### Pros

* Mechanical.
* Detachable palm rest.
* Programmable firmware.

### Cons

* Not a split keyboard.
* Layouts are virtual only, the printed keycaps stay QWERTY, as far as I see.
* Terrible navigation key setup.

### Summary

Two important factors for me are physical layout and splittability. This
keyboard fails both. While it is a portable device, that's not a priority for me
at this time.
