Today [this thread][gh:gaming-keypad] happened to come my way, and it gave me so many ideas to ponder about!

 [gh:gaming-keypad]: https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=93039.0

The look, the design, and the ergonomics of that keypad are *sweet*, and some of the ideas I could likely adapt to a trackball. With buttons on top, and joystick on the side, and a shape designed for grip, this almost translates 1-to-1 into a thumb-controlled trackball.

What if I made a trackball, that was similarly designed for grip? With less adjustability, less keys, a ball instead of a joystick, and more tilting. That may make it impossible to have a useful palm key, unless I tilt it very high - but I plan to do that anyway. I could have two buttons on the inner side of the grip, for index and middle finger. Two buttons above those, same fingers, but pressed in a slightly lesser gripping state.

This could work. Now I need to draw a sketch, and compare the feels - at least in theory. Lots of hand gestures forthcoming that make my wife question my sanity...
