Buttons! With a gripping setup, arcade-style buttons are out, which makes me sad, as they looked awesome. Perhaps I can find a good place for them anyway? But I digress. For the real buttons, I'm now considering [Kailh Low Profile Browns][kailh:lp:brown], with [suitable caps][kailh:lp:caps]. I do want to use a mechanical switch for the mouse buttons, at least the left & right one. If I end up with a hand-base bar or something similar, that may end up being non-mechanical.
