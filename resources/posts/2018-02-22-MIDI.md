I came across a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVf_el4N0tI) this morning, that showed how to build a simple MIDI controller. It has buttons, knobs, and a lot of things my trackball will have too. It is also a whole lot easier to build, so I might build something like it first, to practice and experiment.
