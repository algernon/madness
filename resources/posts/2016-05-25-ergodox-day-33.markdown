It has been over a month of receiving the [ErgoDox EZ][ez], and it has been my
daily driver at work for most of that time, after the first weekend, which I
spent with it at home. In this time, I learned a lot about my typing habits, my
preferences, and about the keyboard too. In this summary you read now, I will
try to not only describe how I use the keyboard, but the whys too, the process
that led to the setup I have right now.

It all [started][blog:lfkb] with watching a Clojure/conj video about keyboards:
it spiked my interest in ergonomic keyboards, and it is all "downhill" form
there. Over the course of a day, I don't type much, but when I sit down to enter
text, I do it in short, fast bursts, as thoughts flow from my brain, through my
fingers, into the computer. This puts some bursty burden on my hands, and I
started to feel the toll. But this is something I only notice now, after a month
of paying closer attention to how I use the keyboard. Prior to that, it was just
curiosity and intuition that drove me down this path.

Of all the keyboards I wanted to try, I ordered a [keyboardio Model 01][m01]
first, but that is yet to ship (which is fine, I expected that, and I love
reading their updates - wish everyone who runs a crowdfunding campaign would do
at least half as good a communication as they do). In the meantime, my desire
for a better, programmable and ergonomic keyboard reached a threshold, where my
daily outbursts about keyboards became so desperate, that my wife told me to
just buy a keyboard for work too, one that ships sooner.

That keyboard was the ErgoDox EZ, my second choice from the original list, and
this is the story of a romance that's still all pink and happy after a month.

# The Beginning

The first day was incredibly annoying, as one wold expect. I started with
replacing the stock firmware, with something I thought to be closer to what I
will enjoy: I took the [ordinary layout][ez:ordinary], and switched it from
QWERTY to Dvorak, to look something like this:

 [ez:ordinary]: https://github.com/jackhumbert/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboard/ergodox_ez/keymaps/ordinary#readme

At this point, I already started to deviate from the original in fundamental
ways: I had no use for the `Meh` and `Hyper` keys, as I did not need any
additional modifiers.

As I do a lot of coding, the various brackets and parens are used often, and I
wanted to have easy access to them, without having to switch to another layer,
so they were given dedicated keys on the base layer, and are there to this day.
I can hit them with minimal stretching of my index fingers.

With this layout, typing most things was convenient - but the bottom row is
something I had, and still have, trouble using properly, so I had to move the
modifiers somewhere else. Not to mention the dissonance between `Alt` being on
the bottom row, along with the `GUI` key, while `Control` is out on the side...
The side is something I try to avoid too, my pinkies are not happy when they
need to stretch, or reach sideways.

# Thumbs & stickies

Since `Shift` was already there, I figured, why not move the rest to the thumb
cluster as well? I do not need two of the modifiers, I only ever used the ones
on the left side, even on my previous keyboards. The only exception was the
right `Alt`, because that is my compose key, but on the ErgoDox, I have a layer
for all characters I was using compose for, so I do not need that key exposed.

From the very beginning, I was experimenting with sticky modifiers, where you
don't have to hold them, they stay on until toggled off. I have a massive
distaste towards key chords, because they place additional load on my poor
brain. I'm not a smart person, you see: my brain has very limited capacity for
short-term, unimportant stuff, such as remembering when to release a held key.
It turns out, I work much better if I only do a single thing at a time, and that
includes tapping keys too (boy, Steno will be hard!).

At first, at the time of the above layout, only `Shift` was sticky, but after
moving the modifiers to the thumb cluster - pictured below -, I made the rest of
them sticky too.

 ![Day 22](/assets/asylum/images/posts/ergodox-day-22/base-layer.png)

The `ESC` key was moved to the thumb cluster, while the `Menu` key was banished
to the inner top corners of the keyboard halves. You see, I use `ESC` often, so
having it at an easy to reach place is good.

# The Long Tap

At this time, I still had a layer for symbols, but I hardly ever used it. I
spent most of the day on the base layer. As such, the unnecessary layers were
removed, things got simplified. This meant that some keys gained new
functionality: the number row started to act as function keys, when pressed for
a longer period than normal tapping:

 ![Day 28](/assets/asylum/images/posts/ergodox-day-28/base-layer.png)

During daily use, I found the bottom row to be nigh useless. The only key I can
conveniently reach is the innermost one. So I put two symbols that are normally
under my pinky, to these places: `:` to the left, `-` to the right. This turned
out to be very convenient, I used to have trouble reaching them before.

Around this time, I discovered how one-shot modifiers are supposed to work, and
tried it: incredible success! Improved speed, accuracy and comfort.

# Hungarian layer

Based on this experiment, I started to pay more attention to how I use my
layers, and it turned out, that I can make the Hungarian layer a kind-of
one-shot layer too: when I type an accented character, it is very uncommon to
type another following immediately. Thus, the layer is active only until a
single Hungarian character is pressed.

 ![Hungarian layer](/assets/asylum/images/posts/ergodox-day-33/hun-layer.png)

On this layer, the accented characters are at the same position as their base
variant. For some, which can have other diatribes, the long one is on top,
short's on bottom. Pretty simple, and it was easy to get used to.

# The Emacs layer

Similarly to the `Hungarian` layer, the `Emacs` layer - which includes cursor
and mouse movements - was also turned into a one-shot layer. I navigate a lot,
and the cursors on the base layer are only useful on occasional use, so I
started to turn more and more to this layer, but switching back and forth when I
wanted to do some editing was cumbersome. This is why the original navigation
layer has some emacs-related keys, that help me escape back to edit mode after
navigating for a while.

This layer is pictured below:

 ![Emacs layer](/assets/asylum/images/posts/ergodox-day-33/emacs-layer.png)

This will need some explanation. I was in the middle of some heavy refactoring
when I came up with this setup: I selected, cut, and then pasted large amounts
of stuff around, before transforming them. This needed a lot of navigation,
which is painful on the base layer, but also needed editor commands, that were
on the base layer. So I made dedicated copy and paste buttons. By default, they
use Spacemacs sequences, but the bottom row on the left side can set the mode:
to Spacemacs, Terminal and traditonal. These change what sequences the copy &
paste keys will send. These keys, by the way, are multi-purpose too. When
tapped, the copy key copies, but when held longer, it will cut. Paste will paste
on tap, but delete when held.

There are also a few keys that allow me to delete stuff, or trigger a keypress,
and escape back to the base layer. This allows me to navigate around, then press
`i`, and both enter into **insert mode**, but also switches back to the base
layer. The same is done for `a` and `r`.

# One-handed

Another new thing I have not showcased is the one-handed layout:

 ![One-handed layout](/assets/asylum/images/posts/ergodox-day-33/one-handed-layout.png)

This has seen little use so far. The purpose is to be able to use all parts of
the layout, when the other hand is occupied, by mousing for example.

# The newest base layer

And finally, the latest incarnation of the base layout:

 ![Base layout](/assets/asylum/images/posts/ergodox-day-33/base-layer.png)
 
Not many changes this time: the trigger key for the `Hungarian` layer moved to a
better position, and I have a free key, which I will likely use as the leader
key for unicode input.

# Keyboard observations

I like the hardware, a lot. Paying a hefty amount of cash for a split keyboard,
when I have never tried any before, was a big risk, but fortunately, it turned
out well. The increased comfort and the programmability made me more productive,
and happier too.

The thumb cluster is amazing, even though it is far from perfect: I can easily
hit the two big keys, and perhaps one or two of the small ones, but the rest
needs movement. Nevertheless, the cluster is still incredible, and I miss it
dearly whenever I have to type on my old keyboard at home.

The tilting kit is something I am still experimenting with, to find the right
angle, and the best split position.

The switches I chose when ordering were Gateron Browns, because these were the
only non-clicky tactile ones. I hate linears, and clicky noises, so this was my
only option. I like them, but I think I may want something a bit heavier in the
long run. Not sure about that, though. For the next few years, browns will be
fine.
