Although just [six days ago][blog:ed:48] it seemed I am done doing major changes
to my [layout][layout] for a while, and the base layer will not be touched, I
was wrong. It's never done. There is always something to tweak, to make things
even more comfortable, and fit for my hands and usage patterns. Nevertheless,
while there were a number of updates to the keyboard, the path I started on with
the ErgoDox continues, and I'm at a stage where it's no more just a keyboard.
It's something bigger: as I started paying more attention to ergonomics, I am
slowly transforming my environment both at work, and at home.

As a consequence of the above, this will be the last post titled *ErgoDox: Day
N*, but worry not! Next ones will have similar content, but a different title,
to reflect what I will be talking about.

Lets begin with the layout changes, to keep the tradition!

## Layout changes

While my previous layout (pictured below) was very nice, when I was using it for
coding in C, or just coding in general, some things felt... off.

![Base layer, day 48](/assets/asylum/images/posts/ergodox-day-48/base-layer.png)

First, there are some duplicate symbols: `-` appears twice, and so does `:`.
Ever since putting `-` on the right half, into a thumb-accessible position, I
have not used the other one, and the only reason I ever hit the `;` under the
left pinky was to get that symbol instead of its shifted variant, the `:`. These
felt like a waste, especially the `-`, so I looked around to see what keys may
benefit from moving to either of these positions. I noticed that I keep typing
`/` and `?` often when coding, and having to stretch my right pinky up to reach
them was not ideal. You see, while some fingers like stretching up more than
bending downwards, the pinky rather bends down, than reaches up. So it was a
no-brainer to move the `/?` key to the left side, replacing `;`. I then taught
my firmware to input a `;` when tapping `:` with the `Shift` on. After these, I
moved the `=+` key one row down (since the `/?` that was there was moved), so
that's easier to tap too!

With that done, it was time to do something about the `-` on the left half. I
found no other key that I wanted to move there, at least not immediately, so I
turned that into a `Media Prev/Next` key. This worked okay, but looked a tad
awkward, having two pinky keys above it, when the pinky does not like to
stretch... Wait a moment! If the pinky does not like to stretch, why on earth do
I have `Tab` so high? Why not on the home row? Good question. I don't know. So I
swapped these keys, and put `Tab` on the home row.

With these changes, the layout now looks like this:

Been typing with this layout for the past few days, and it's a definite
improvement over the former. Here's hoping that this will stick for a while.

## Improving the working environment

One major reason for choosing a new keyboard was to improve the ergonomics of my
tools. But the keyboard is only one such tool, there are a number of others in
my environment that could use an update. Replacing my mouse was high on the
list, but that's a longer process (more about that in a bit!), and something
else came up suddenly. You see, over the past few years, I gained a bit more
weight than it would be healthy, let alone ideal, so it's been a desire for some
time to go and exercise. This past weekend, we finally got our acts together
with my lovely wife, and went for some cycling and running. It was awesome, and
tough, and a lot in one afternoon, but I felt energised, proud. In a fit of
enthusiasm, sparkled by the weekend's events, we transformed my working desk at
home into a standing desk, using some cheap IKEA furniture and some boxes.
(Picture coming later, not at home to take one.)

At first, I was worried a bit that this may be too sudden a change, or hard to
get used to, but boy, was I wrong! It's incredible. I have much more freedom and
space, I can wander around with my headphones on, shuffle up and down while
thinking (which is most of what I do), and stop at the keyboard to burst out
some code once I figure out what to write. I can place my weight on one leg or
the other, I can lean on the IKEA furniture if I want to rest my legs a tiny
bit. I can just walk away, into the kitchen, or to kiss my wife, without first
having to stand up, push the chair back. I found myself doing all these a lot
more often since. I feel better, and am enjoying the setup a lot, it's a blazing
success.

It does feel a bit weird, too, because I expected that a standing desk will put
much more burden on my legs, and that it will take a while and some strong will
to get used to - which is why I have not tried it before - but my experience so
far is the exact opposite! Standing up was liberating. While I do not know how
it will feel standing there eight hours a day, I know I can easily do four.
Therefore, we are exploring our options back at work too, to see how we could
achieve something similar there too.

There is one issue with my standing desk at home, however: the mouse.

## Of mice and men

The little furniture thingy we put on top of my table to lift the keyboard, the
mouse, and the monitor (the latter with the help of an additional box)... that
thing is narrow. It can hold my keyboard just fine, but I can't place the mouse
beside it. Only in front of it, or behind it, and there's little room to move
it. This is awkward, inconvenient, and downright silly. A trackball would be a
much better fit. While I'd still have to reach it behind the keyboard, moving
the cursor would become a lot easier. This setup is obviously temporary, as I
can't fit a split keyboard here - but we'll worry about that later, once I have
one at home too.

For now, we need to sort out the mouse situation, both at home, and at work,
because at work, I do have a split keyboard, and I really, really want to place
my mouse between the two halves. Can't do that with a traditional one, so I need
a trackball.

But which one do I choose? The last time I tried trackballs (a
[Logitech Trackman Marble][ltm]), I found them awful, but that was almost a
decade ago, if not more. May have been some other trackball too, but it was a
Logitech, index-operated one. If I invest into an expensive trackball, and I
won't like it, that would not be fun. I already invested a lot in keyboards, and
that was a huge gamble itself, I'd rather not do the same again, not going to
risk my good luck.

Looking around in stores, the most common trackball - which is also affordble! -
is the [Logitech M570][lm570], a thumb-operated trackball with scroll wheel, a
good number of buttons, and a lot of reviews praise it. Even have a colleague in
the office who uses one, and likes it.

My problem is, I don't want a thumb-operated one. Placed between the keyboard
halves, an index-operated one feels much more natural.

At this point, I sat down, and stated looking at my options, and my requirements:

* I want something affordable, below $50, preferably.
* I'm only interested in trackballs: trackpads, trackpoints and traditional mice
  (even vertical or ergonomic ones) are out. The latter due to space reasons,
  the former two because I hate them still. I want to move my hands as little as
  possible, so fondling a ball is preferable over caressing some surface, or
  poking a tiny button-like thing.
* Due to being placed between keyboard halves, I want a finger-operated
  trackball, as opposed to a thumb-operated one.
* I have normal hands, maybe even slightly larger than average. Small gadgets
  are not my thing.
* I use the scroll wheel often, so I need that, or an equivalent.
* I prefer wired over wireless. I can hide the cables nicely, and I feel more
  confident about wired things.
* Large balls are nice.
* Must not require special drivers, or pre-configuring under Windows. I use
  Linux, it must work out of the box without special software.
* Preferably not mouse-shaped, it won't be on the side of the keyboard, and I
  don't want to hold it like I would hold a traditional mouse.
* Programmable buttons are a great plus, but not required.
* At least two buttns, but three are best. I don't need more than that. Four, I
  could perhaps make use of, but not more.
  
With these requirements, the list is rather short, but to keep the suspense,
lets go over some of the options I explored!

### [Logitech Trackman Marble][ltm]

Affordable, finger-operated wired trackball, that does not require special
software, and has a nice ball. But it does not have a scroll wheel, nor an
equivalent, and the shape of it is like that of a mouse. The button placement is
also not to my liking, and having two small buttons pretty much embedded into
the two large ones is terrible. No way I can make use of those, so they'd just
be an annoyance.

While it works out of the box under Linux, it does have special, windows-only
software that can be used to tweak its behaviour, but the device has no memory
of its own, so this is pretty much useless.

All of these together rule out this trackball.

### [Logitech M570][lm570]

Affordable, but thumb-operated and wireless, and looks like a traditional mouse.
This is obviously meant to be placed by the right of the keyboard, not in the
middle.

On the plus side, it has a scroll wheel, better button placement than the
Trackman Marble, but that's not enough to offset the other deficiencies.

### [L-Trac Glow](http://clearlysuperiortech.com/cst2545wglproductpage.html)

Finger-operated, nice large ball, scroll wheel, well placed buttons, and looks
fit to be used between the keyboard halves, and works out of the box under
Linux, at least according to the vendor.

However, the scroll wheel does not look convenient, and the price is a bit
steep, almost three times my budget. And while it looks more fit to be placed in
the middle, it still retains some of the traditional mouse-shape.

### [Kensington Expert Mouse](http://www.kensington.com/us/us/4493/k64325/expert-mousespan-classregsymspan-wired-trackball)

Nice, large ball, scroll ring, four buttons, no resemblance to a traditional
mouse, finger-operated, and from what I could gather, works under Linux out of
the box, or at least with minimal configuration.

Looks good, and would be an option, but the price is twice my budget. Not
entirely sold on the large buttons either, it seems the idea is to have my hand
put on it, and roll the ball with the palm, so I have access to all buttons...
not sure I'd like that.

But an option nevertheless!

### [Kensington Slimblade](http://www.kensington.com/en/no/4493/k72327eu/slimblade-trackball)

Large ball, four buttons, finger-operated, no resemblance to traditional mice,
should work on Linux out of the box. The scrolling solution is not something I'd
like (twisting the ball), even though the shape and the buttons are something I
like more than the one on the Expert Mouse.

The price is still over my budget too, but less so.

### [Elecom Deft](http://www2.elecom.co.jp.e.gj.hp.transer.com/products/M-DT1URBK.html)

Scroll wheel, buttons, finger-operated, and affordable. But it looks like a
traditional mouse, and is rather small. As such, not an option sadly, even
though reviews are good.

### [Kensington Orbit with Scroll Ring](http://www.kensington.com/us/us/4493/k72337us/orbitspan-classregsymspan-trackball-with-scroll-ring)

Largeish ball, scroll ring, finger-operated, does not resemble a traditional
mouse, works under Linux and is affordable and wired.

I like the button placements, and the scroll ring is something I believe I could
get used to, fast. The downside is that it only has two buttons, no middle
button - but I can do without that.

### The verdict

It looks like my two reasonable options are the
[Kensington Expert Mouse](#kensington-expert-mouse) and the
[Kensington Orbit with Scroll ring](#kensington-orbit-with-scroll-ring). Of the
two, I think I prefer the Orbit, even though the ball is larger in the Expert
Mouse. For now, due to my budget being low, I am going with the Orbit, and will
see how it fares.

I'm hoping that I will be able to report back on my experience using a trackball
at work in a few weeks. Until then, I'll likely post an update or two about the
standing desk experience.
