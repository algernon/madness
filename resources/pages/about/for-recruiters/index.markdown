title: List of conditions and preferences, for recruiters
---

Every once in a while - at an increasing frequency - recruiters find
me with all kinds of offers and opportunities. Most of these make no
sense, and with only a little bit of research, they wouldn't even been
sent. Now, I know that research is hard, especially when there are so
many places to look for information. So just below, I'll put together
a list of conditions, for recruiters. If **all** of them are met, we
can talk. If any of them is not, there is no point in mailing me,
you'll just get pointed to this page.

* I have been a Debian Developer since 2001, I intend to continue
  doing that, keep all my current roles, and perhaps even find other
  ways I can volunteer my free time to Debian. I'm not willing to
  sacrifice this.
* I live in Hungary, and I am not willing to relocate. Periodic visits
  to HQ and remote work is, of course, acceptable. The reasons why I
  am unwilling to move are, in no particular order:
    * My wife lives and works here.
    * My studies bind me to Hungary, I cannot get a degree in
      Hungarian Human Arts anywhere else.
    * I like the country, and unless I have no other option,
      I'm not moving.
* I run Debian on my computers, all of them (except phone and tablet,
  which run Android until I can run Debian on them). I am not going to
  run anything else, except in a virtual machine or a chroot.
* With that said, the only packaging work I am willing to do is Debian
  packaging. No RPM .spec files, thank you very much.
* I will not work for **Google**, **Microsoft**, **Apple**, **Oracle**,
  **Amazon**, or any bank or financial institute. If you are trying to recruit
  me for any of these, stop right now.

I do not think these are all that strange conditions, but most
companies where recruiters found me from, failed on one or more of the
above (some even on all of them). However, these were only the
requirements. If you are truly interested in presenting me with an
opportunity that I should consider, you will find a list of
preferences below.

Please note that all my conditions **and** all my preferences are
satisfied by my current employer, with whom I am very happy with.

* I prefer working on and with Free Software.
* I don't like long commutes.
* I like reasonably flexible work hours, though.
* I like attending and speaking at conferences.
* My heart lies with functional programming languages, Clojure, in
  particular (but Haskell is great too).
* I like smart collegues and a great company spirit.
