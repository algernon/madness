I'm involved in a number of projects, but most of them will not be listed here.
This is a selection of projects only, of those that I deem important to
highlight, for one reason or the other.

At the moment, there's one big project I'm working on, as a part-time contractor
to [Keyboardio][keyboardio]: the [Kaleidoscope][kaleidoscope] firmware and
related projects. One such project is [porting Kaleidoscope][porting] to all
kinds of keyboards, read more about it there.
